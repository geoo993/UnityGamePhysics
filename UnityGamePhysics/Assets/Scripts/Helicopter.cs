    This class handles all the initialization
    and instantiation of the helicopter entity as well as the virtual world.
    The Helicopter class is also the place where the type of helicopter is selected and
    the capabilities are indicated. As more helicopters are added to the Army’s inventory and
    current helicopter capabilities change, this is the module that must be updated to
    accurately reflect these advances.
